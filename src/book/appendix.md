REV. J. GORDON & COL. ADAM MURRAY MEMORIAL TABLET


This Tablet
is
Erected to the Memory of the
Revd. James Gordon
Third Minister of Glendermott
in acknowledgement of
and as
a testimony to his great services
to the cause of
truth and freedom
through rousing to resolute resistance
the parishioners and kinsmen
and through
his efforts afterwards in urging Kirke
to relieve the Maiden City in 1689
and of
Colonel Adam Murray of Ling
a Member of this Congregation
whose timely and fearless action
prevented the surrender of the City
and whose
unflinching bravery and unshaken faith
were an ever present incentive
to that heroic endurance and steadfastness
which under God saved the City;
And in gratitude to God for raising up
and sustaining heroic men and leaders
and for
working through them a great deliverance.

“God is our refuge and our strength
In straits a present aid,
Therefore although the earth remove
We will not be afraid.”
