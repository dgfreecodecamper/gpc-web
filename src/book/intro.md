# History Book
The congregation of Glendermott was established in 1654 and has enjoyed a long history. A meeting house was built somewhere between the present building and the old graveyard further up the valley.
After 30 years it became necessary to erect a larger building and in 1696 a new church was built on the present site. Mr Ryan Donaghey has complied a detailed history of the congregation spanning the 350 year history. This research was published in a book titled “The bush still burns”. Most of the contents of this books have been published on this site and are available from the links below.
