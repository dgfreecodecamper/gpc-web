CLONDERMOT, which is the name of a townland as well as a whole parish, is derived from the name of the clan who ruled there, the CLAN DIARMADA or the clan of Dermot. This clan was a Sept of the CENEL EOGHAIN on the East of the River Foyle. The Clan Diarmada were the O’Carolans whose chief was O’Cairellain.

The O’Donnells drove the O’Carolans out of the Magh-Ithe on the West side of the River Foyle and they evidently established themselves on the East side of the river. The Parish passed to the Bishop of Derry during the Wars of Shane O’Neil.


The country from the Foyle to the Bann was sometimes called ‘Patria de O’Kane.’ The chief residence of the O’Kanes was in their castle situated on an island in the East lough of two Enagh Loughs. The Barony of Armagh was called after this Castle of Enagh. This Barony was one of the eight baronies which comprised the County of Tyrone, which then included the County of Londonderry.

The Barony of Armagh was changed into Tirkeeran about 1639, and comprised the Parishes of Cumber, Clondermot and Faughanvale (or Muff). So the Parish of Glendermott is part of the Barony of Tirkeeran. It measures approximately nine miles by five miles, and has 173 acres of water. There are over 21,514 acres in the parish of which 4,410 acres is bog, mountain etc.

Evidently the Parish had little to offer. There were some natural resources such as rock to quarry. There were also deposits of sand and gravel that had been left as a result of the Ice Age which had occurred approximately 10,000 years ago, when movements of huge fields of ice from Donegal and even as far away as Scotland, carved out our landscape. Other natural resources were woodlands of oak and birch, water-power and of course the fertile soil where settlers could eke out a living.

St Patrick is said to have founded a church in Ardkill and St Columbkille founded a monastery in the Parish. Ailid O’Dermit founded a nunnery at Rossnagalliagh in 879.

Land in Ireland was divided up into large areas called baronies, parishes or electoral wards. Each of these larger units was divided into townlands. There are 77 townlands in the Parish of Glendermott. Each townland was given a name relating to some characteristic such as height or hill, trees, vegetation, lakes, fortifications or even relating to the clan or family name associated with the area.

Many townlands in Ireland begin with ‘bally’ derived from the Irish word baile (town or townland). Other prevalent Irish names which feature in our Parish are: drum or droin = ridge, alt = height, ard = high, coil or killy = wood or vegetation, lis and dun = fort, gort = field, carry = moor, more = great.

The following is a list of all the townlands in the Parish of Glendermott and the meanings of their names.
